I wrote this tool while working with the AT command specification for call barring and other supplementary services on mobile phones. I was regularly working using HyperTerminal and quickly got tired of continually entering AT commands, so I wrote a GUI tool to represent the options of the call barring specification and have the application send the commands for me.

It consists of a series of tabs containing controls for specific AT commands and a terminal window displaying the commands that have been sent and the responses from the connected device.

The application is designed to be easily extended to incorporate more AT commands.
